This project aims to provide a simulator to examine the performance of cache replacement policies for data analytics systems. We replay the workloads from [the Alibaba Trace](https://github.com/alibaba/clusterdata). Currentlyï¼Œthis simulator supports three cache replacement policies, the Least-Recently-Used (LRU) policy, the least-Reference-Count ([LRC](https://home.cse.ust.hk/~weiwa/papers/lrc-infocom17.pdf)) and [MEMTUNE] (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7516034). Readers can also test their own cache policies following the guidance below.
